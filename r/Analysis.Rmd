Outline of selected figures and analyses:

- Grazing differences between islands: (site or island level?)
-- ANOVAs to test statistical significance of differences here
- Total grazing impact of site-level biomass: measured vs. reported grazing rates (add line or color by feeding rate)
- Something looking at relationship with algal index vs. scarid biomass  
- SEM?

Notes: 
- re: lms/gamms: don't focus on these for now, the data has so many colinearities... if anything, use full PCA in model analysis
- Exclude Barbuda from this analysis...?
